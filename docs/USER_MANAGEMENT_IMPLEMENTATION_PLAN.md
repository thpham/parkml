## 🚨 **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss during schema changes

   - _Mitigation_: Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures

2. **Authentication Changes**: Risk of breaking existing user access

   - _Mitigation_: Gradual rollout with fallback mechanisms

3. **Multi-Clinic Isolation**: Risk of data leakage between organizations
   - _Mitigation_: Thorough testing and query auditing

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Performance Impact**: Risk of slowing down with new features

   - _Mitigation_: Performance monitoring and optimization

2. **User Experience**: Risk of confusing new interfaces
   - _Mitigation_: User testing and iterative design

## 🔄 **Implementation Order Rationale**

The implementation follows this logical sequence:

1. **Database First**: Foundation must be solid before building features
2. **Authentication Second**: Security layer needed before user management
3. **Core Features Third**: Assignment system is the main functionality
4. **Scalability Fourth**: Multi-clinic support builds on core features
5. **Advanced Features Last**: Emergency access and auditing are enhancements

This order ensures that:

- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Critical functionality is implemented early
- Risk is minimized through incremental development
- Testing can be done incrementally

## 📝 **Notes & Decisions**

### Architecture Decisions

- **Prisma ORM**: Chosen for type safety and migration support
- **JWT with Claims**: Organization and role information in tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Middleware-based implementation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for compliance

### User Experience Decisions

- **Patient Consent Required**: All caregiver assignments need patient approval
- **Emergency Access**: Time-limited with full audit trail
- **Invitation System**: Secure token-based with expiration
- **Organization Isolation**: Complete data separation between clinics
