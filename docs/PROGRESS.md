# ParkML Development Progress

## Project Overview
ParkML is a comprehensive monitoring platform for Parkinson's disease symptom tracking, designed to support healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers with systematic data collection and analysis.

## Current Status: Phase 1 Implementation ✅

### Completed Features (High Priority)
- ✅ **Frontend & Backend Architecture**: Complete TypeScript monorepo with React frontend and Express backend
- ✅ **Database Schema Design**: Comprehensive schema for symptom tracking with JSONB/TEXT support
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Full REST API for authentication, patient management, and symptom entries
- ✅ **React Components**: Complete symptom tracking forms with tabbed interface
- ✅ **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control (patient/caregiver/healthcare_provider)
- ✅ **UI/UX**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, mobile-friendly interface
- ✅ **Development Experience**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production compatibility
- ✅ **Bug Fixes**: Resolved empty login page issue and concurrent development setup
- ✅ **Prisma ORM Migration**: Complete migration from custom database abstraction to Prisma ORM with enhanced type safety and developer experience
- ✅ **Production Deployment**: Dokku deployment configuration with automated database migrations and production build process

### Pending Features (High Priority)
- ⏳ **Data Encryption & Security**: End-to-end encryption and enhanced security measures
- ⏳ **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation and error handling for all forms

### Pending Features (Medium Priority)
- ⏳ **Multilingual Support**: Starting with French language support
- ⏳ **Form Validation**: Enhanced client-side and server-side validation

### Pending Features (Low Priority)
- ⏳ **Data Visualization Dashboard**: Charts and analytics for symptom progression

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- **Forms**: React Hook Form 7.55.3
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 6.30.1
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons, React Hot Toast

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 24.4.0
- **Framework**: Express 4.21.2 with TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Database ORM**: Prisma ORM with type-safe queries and automatic migrations

### Development Tools
- **Package Manager**: npm with workspaces
- **TypeScript**: 5.7.3
- **Linting**: ESLint 8.57.1
- **Development**: tsx watch mode, concurrently for multi-service dev
- **Database**: Prisma with SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod) support

## Architecture Highlights

### Database Architecture
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database operations with automatic migrations
- **Dual Database Support**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Automatic Schema Management**: Database migrations and schema evolution
- **Type Safety**: Auto-generated TypeScript types for all database operations
- **Development Experience**: Zero-setup database initialization with seeding

### Security Features
- **JWT Authentication**: 24-hour token expiration
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Role-Based Access**: Patient, caregiver, and healthcare provider roles
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for secure cross-origin requests

### Development Experience
- **Zero Setup**: Prisma with SQLite eliminates PostgreSQL requirement for local development
- **Concurrent Development**: Frontend and backend run simultaneously
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic restarts for both frontend and backend
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across monorepo with Prisma generated types
- **Database Tools**: Prisma Studio for database visualization and management
- **Auto-seeding**: Pre-populated test accounts for immediate development

## Current Deployment Status
- **Environment**: Development-ready with production deployment configuration
- **Database**: Prisma with SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) with automatic migrations
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, TypeScript compilation for backend
- **Deployment**: Dokku configuration with automated database migrations
- **Version Control**: Node.js 24.4.0 specified in .nvmrc for consistency

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Security Enhancement**: Implement data encryption and additional security measures
2. **Form Validation**: Add comprehensive validation across all forms
3. **Multilingual Support**: Implement French language support
4. **Data Visualization**: Create dashboard with symptom progression charts
